List of bugs introduced after the refactor

1) Mergers of two hotels of size 3 don't get detected as a tiebreak merger
   even though mergers of two size 2 hotels do

2) handleHotelAutoMergeClick assumes the hotel at the end will always be the
   last one standing. In the case of two hotels that are tied or if the
   state.mergingHotels aren't sorted by size, this results in incorrect results

3) If the starting 6 tiles have two adjacent tiles, then creating a hotel does
   not produce correct results. E.G. if D10 and D11 are part of the initial 6,
   placing D9 only creates a hotel containing D9 and D10, and not D11.

4) In the case of a single bonus receiver (no secondaries), the zeroes are
   treated as if they're secondary bonus receivers and get money even though
   they own no shares of the hotel
